## Complete Beginner's Guide

This guide assumes you have **zero coding experience**. Follow every step exactly.

---

## Step 1: Create a GitHub Account

GitHub is a website where code is stored. You need a free account.

1. Go to [github.com](https://github.com)
2. Click **"Sign up"** in the top right
3. Enter your email, create a password, and choose a username
4. Complete the verification and click **"Create account"**
5. Check your email and verify your account

---

## Step 2: Copy This Project to Your Account

This is called "forking" - it creates your own copy that you can edit.

1. Make sure you're logged into GitHub
2. Go to the original repository (the link you were sent)
3. Click the **"Fork"** button in the top right corner
4. On the next screen, just click **"Create fork"**
5. Wait a few seconds - you now have your own copy!

## Step 3: Change the Name to Your Girlfriend's Name

Now we'll edit the code to use your girlfriend's name instead of "Alyssa".

### Edit the HTML file:

1. In your forked repository, click on the file called **`index.html`**
2. Click the **pencil icon** (Edit this file) in the top right of the file view
3. Use **Ctrl+F** (Windows) or **Cmd+F** (Mac) to open the search box
4. Search for `Alyssa`
5. You'll find it in 3 places - change each one to your girlfriend's name:
   - Line 6: `<title>Alyssa, Will You Be My Valentine?</title>` - change `Alyssa` to her name
   - Line 20: `Alyssa, will you be my Valentine?` - change `Alyssa` to her name
   - Line 28: `Alyssa said YES!` - change `Alyssa` to her name
   - Line 32: `Alyssa, will you be my Valentine?` - change `Alyssa` to her name
6. Scroll down and click the green **"Commit changes"** button
7. In the popup, click **"Commit changes"** again

---

## Step 4: Turn On GitHub Pages (This Makes Your Website Live)

GitHub can host your website for free. Here's how to turn it on:

1. In your repository, click **"Settings"** (the tab with a gear icon near the top)
2. In the left sidebar, scroll down and click **"Pages"**
3. Under **"Source"**, you'll see a dropdown that says "None"
4. Click it and select **"main"** (or "master")
5. Leave the folder as **"/ (root)"**
6. Click **"Save"**
7. **Wait 1-2 minutes** for GitHub to build your site

---

## Step 5: Get Your Website Link

1. Stay on the **Settings > Pages** screen
2. After a minute or two, refresh the page
3. You'll see a green box at the top that says: **"Your site is live at https://YOUR-USERNAME.github.io/REPO-NAME/"**
4. Click **"Visit site"** to test it works
5. **Copy this link** - this is what you'll send to your girlfriend!

---

## Step 6: Send the Link

1. Open your email
2. Compose a new message to your girlfriend
3. Paste the link from Step 5
4. Write something sweet like: "I made this for you, click the link!"
5. Send it and wait for her reaction!

## Troubleshooting

### "I can't find the Fork button"
Make sure you're logged into GitHub and viewing the original repository (not your own).

### "My site says 404 or isn't loading"
- Wait a few more minutes - it can take up to 5 minutes the first time
- Go back to Settings > Pages and make sure "main" is selected as the source
- Make sure the repository is set to **Public** (Settings > General > scroll to "Danger Zone" > Change visibility)

### "I messed up the code and now it's broken"
1. Go to the file you edited
2. Click the pencil icon to edit
3. Look for anything that looks wrong (missing `>` or `<` symbols, extra spaces)
4. Or: Delete your fork and start over from Step 2

### "The name still says Alyssa"
- Clear your browser cache: **Ctrl+Shift+R** (Windows) or **Cmd+Shift+R** (Mac)
- Make sure you clicked "Commit changes" after editing
- Check that you edited the file in YOUR fork, not the original

## How It Works

When your girlfriend opens the link:
1. She sees a cute question asking her to be your Valentine
2. If she tries to click "No", the button runs away!
3. When she clicks "Yes", there's a celebration with confetti and fireworks
